# Poll-Voting-Django-2.2

Created a simple Polling System using Django 2.2.
Polls is the app in mysite project. Python files views.py , models.py , urls.py are the files of Polls folder itself.
Error is in the views.py file that the voted function the try block is not able to function hence resulting in unablility to count the votes.
